======================
Operating System Prep
======================
Install Windows 98 Second Edition


======================
RS422 Driver Prep
======================
Note: This procedure assumes that you have an adapter with the FTDI chipset like the DTech USB

Download FTDI Chip drivers: https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP/Win98/R10906.zip
Unzip the folder to C:\ftdi on the Windows 98 machine
Plug in RS422 adapter to the Windows 98 computer

Step through the "Add New Hardware Wizard"
 * Next
 * Select "Search for the best driver for your device"
 * Next
 * Click "Specify a location"
 * Type in C:\ftdi\R10906 in the box
 * Next
 * Next
 * Finish
 
After installing the driver, find the serial port number
 * Right click on "My Computer"
 * Select "Properties"
 * Click on "Device Manager"
 * Expand Ports (COM & LPT)
 * Make a note of the serial port (most likely COM1)


======================
Java 5 Prep
======================
Download JavaNabuAdapter.zip for Java 5 latest release: https://github.com/cml37/JavaNabuAdapter-java5/releases
Unzip it to C:\nabu on the Windows 98 machine
 * You should have a JavaNabuAdapter.jar and JavaNabuAdapter_lib directory

Download Java 5: https://mirror.nforce.com/pub/drivers/java_jre/jre-1_5_0_22-windows-i586-p.exe
Install Java 5, just click through the selections
  * Typical Setup
  * Accept >
  * Finish
  * Yes to restart

Add java to the path statement
  * Launch a command prompt
  * edit C:\autoexec.bat
  * Add the following line to the bottom of the file
    PATH=%PATH%;C:\progra~1\java\jre1.5.0_22\bin
 * Save and exit


======================
Running the Adapter
======================
Launch the adapter from a command prompt using the serial port from device manager above (quite possibly COM1, so we will show that here):
  C:
  cd \nabu
  java -jar JavaNabuAdapter.jar -Mode Serial -Port COM1 -path headless

If you want CP/M to work, you will also need to copy the contents of the "cpm" directory from the thenabunetwork.com adaptor to C:\nabu\cpm

That's it!
